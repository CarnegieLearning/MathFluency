### The Mathematics Fluency Data Collaborative ###

The Mathematics Fluency Data Collaborative (MFDC) brings together leading experts in cognition and game design to build an R&D platform for developing, refining and distributing high-quality mathematics games. Our focus will be on games to build fluency in mathematics as a basis for number sense.

MFDC will establish a community of practice that values iterative testing and refinement based on careful examination of student data. We will provide data to the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center so that researchers can mine the data to better understand the parameters that lead to success.
