 <p> <p>Rounds:
 For each round you will be presented an equation at the top of the screen.  Your goal is to get 7 correct answers to the equation as fast as possible.  As you click on the answer ball, it will jump to the number line as either correct (green) or incorrect (red). You have to get 7 correct to advance to the next round. After three incorrect answers the round closes. You have 30 seconds to complete a round.  There are four rounds in a level.
 </p>
     <p> Levels:
     At the end of a level (four rounds) your score will be calculated.  You need to have a SILVER or GOLD medal to advance to the next round.  There are four levels to complete. 
      </p>
      <p>Scoring:
      
      120    points for every correct answer
      -100   points for every incorrect answer
      BONUS: 25 points for every second left in each round.
      
      0        - 1000 points = NO medal.
      1000 - 2000 points = BRONZE medal.
      2000 - 4000 points = SILVER medal.
      4000+            points = GOLD medal.
